# BookKeeping
<p>The code here is the result of an introductory course on double entry. I created this simple application to be able to perform on my own the bookkeping duties for my long gone Company in the United Kingdom.</p>
I had no previous expertise on accounting. 
However, with this we managed to have 3 balance sheets certified by the Companies House.
The project here is not functional yet because the definition of the database tables has been lost.
Recreating them to restore functionality is going to be the aim of the project
